      <p class="text-lg">Scientific discovery is entering a new era—powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
        learning (ML). These technologies are enabling breakthroughs across disciplines such as biology, physics,
        chemistry, and materials science. However, one major bottleneck remains: the lack of high-quality,
        domain-specific datasets that are truly <strong>AI-ready</strong>.</p>
      <p class="text-lg"><strong>The 1st Workshop on AI-ready Data for Science Discovery (ADSD 2025)</strong> aims to
        address this critical challenge by building a vibrant, interdisciplinary community focused on the creation,
        curation, and benchmarking of scientific datasets. Hosted at ICDM 2025, ADSD will serve as a platform for
        researchers, practitioners, and data professionals to collaborate on shaping the future of scientific data
        mining.</p>

              Challenges & Opportunities</p>
            <p class="text-gray-800">Advances in deep learning and foundation models have continued to set new
              expectations for general tasks and bring new potential to harness geospatial big data for Earth monitoring
              and geoscience discovery, benefiting broad sectors including agriculture, energy, water, disaster
              response, and urban planning. However, direct applications of deep learning often fall short due to
              challenges posed by geospatial data, including spatial variability that can significantly weaken the
              replicability of AI models over space, limited and expensive-to-collect training samples, and the
              misalignment between pretraining and downstream tasks. To accelerate new AI model development for
              addressing these challenges, large-scale AI-ready benchmark datasets are essential to enable model
              training, testing, and comparison under different scenarios of practical importance to domain experts.
              This talk will showcase several datasets and benchmarks we recently created and open-sourced to support AI
              model development, which: (1) represent large geographic scales from national, continental, to global
              scales; (2) cover different data modalities such as remote sensing imagery (e.g., satellites, UAV),
              in-situ field measurements, and physical simulations; (3) support a variety of machine learning tasks
              including forecasting, segmentation, and emulation; and (4) directly link to important societal
              applications. Moreover, I will also discuss AI challenges embedded in these benchmark datasets for large
              scale applications and potential opportunities in AI model developments to tackle them.

            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-gray-900">Agentic AI for Scientific Discovery: Benchmarks, Frameworks, and
              Applications</p>
            <p class="text-gray-800">The emergence of agentic AI systems marks a pivotal shift in how scientific
              discovery can be automated, interpreted, and scaled. Traditional approaches to computational discovery
              have largely relied on data-driven models that excel at prediction but struggle to reason over scientific
              priors or to integrate structured feedback during the discovery process. In this talk, I will present a
              suite of agentic AI frameworks that leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate, refine, and
              evaluate scientific hypotheses, ranging from symbolic equations to geometric and physical laws, across
              multiple scientific domains. These frameworks collectively form a structured discovery pipeline built
              around two key phases: (1) hypothesis generation, where LLM agents autonomously propose structured and
              interpretable hypotheses by retrieving inspirations and composing new associations, and (2) feedback and
              refinement, where these hypotheses are iteratively improved using signals from data, symbolic
              decomposition, benchmarks, and reasoning consistency. Together, these approaches demonstrate how agentic
              systems can move beyond static text generation toward dynamic reasoning and iterative hypothesis
              formation. Beyond methodology, I will highlight new benchmarks that rigorously test reasoning beyond
              memorization, frameworks such as LLM-SR that integrate scientific priors with evolutionary search for
              adaptive refinement, and applications that showcase interpretable discovery in physics, biology, and
              materials science. Collectively, these contributions demonstrate the evolution of large language models
              from predictive tools to scientific agents capable of symbolic and compositional reasoning, autonomous
              exploration, and interpretable hypothesis generation, laying the foundation for reliable, reproducible,
              and human-aligned scientific discovery.</p>

              growing field in AI for Science where scientific knowledge is deeply integrated in machine learning
              frameworks to produce scientifically grounded, explainable, and generalizable predictions even on
